                    <h2>Multiplayer Game Prototype</h2>
                    <p>
                        A multiplayer game prototype. This project features a custom rendering solution and a custom
                        network protocol for responsive multiplayer movement. I'm especially proud of the `from-scratch` network solution.
                        Real-time multiplayer games are a non-trivial problem.
                        OpenGL was used for rendering, and WinSock was used for networking. <br>

                    <p>
                        A database application for tracking appointments with a repair company. The software uses SQL Server as a backend,
                        which tracks the technicians, vehicles, jobs, and appointments for those jobs. Microsoft Access was used to develop
                        the front-end for the application.<br>

                    <h2>FPS-Deckbuilder Prototype</h2>
                    <p>
                        Built on The Unreal Engine 4, this project was an experimental blend of deckbuilder games and first-person-shooters.
                        The player deals damage, takes damage and dodges attacks to generate resources they can
                        spend on powerful abilities.
                        This project uses OOP programming principles with C++ for full effect to create a complex
                        game character hierarchy, an ability system, and efficient AI. It also takes full advantage of
                        UE4 to implement particle systems, animation state machines, and the Environmental Querying System
