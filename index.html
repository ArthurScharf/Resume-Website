                    Hi! I'm Arthur, a student currently enrolled in <b><a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/computer-programming/">Algonquin College - Computer Programming</a></b>.
                    I've been programming for about 6 years now. I started my journey using Python, and quickly fell in love with the field.
                    I've since made it my mission to learn as much as I can, while exploring the vast world of information technology.
                    Along the way I've come to love game development, game engine programming, and network programming.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    Outside of my school work and personal projects, I maintain an interest in a few hobbies. I love lifting weights. I started going to the gym when I was
                    23. I now lift 5 times a week with no intention of stopping anytime soon.
                    I enjoy playing games with my friends. It's a great social outlet. I also enjoy
                    building and painting miniatures. I've got quite a collection going
                </p>
